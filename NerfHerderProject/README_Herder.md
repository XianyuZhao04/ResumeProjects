This code takes a text file of movie reviews and uses the words said and the ratings given by each review to determine multiple things such as 

1. if the word provided by the user is present in the reviews, if so, how many times and the sentiment score of the given word 
2. if a bunch words or phrases given by a user through a text file is more positive (compliment) or more negative (insult)
3. if given a bunch of words by a user through a text file, give back the word with the highest sentiment score along with its score and the word with the lowest sentiment score along with its score

This code will not stop asking the user to give it a task until the user gives the command equivant to "stop the code"
    
I did not collaborate with anyone to write this code

This code is supposed to generate a picture that is similar to the work of Piet Mondrian. It starts with a blank square and divides the square randomly and if the divided square meets a condition, divide or not divide the square accordingly. When it reaches a dimension small enough, it will no longer be divide but rather be colored. The color that the small square will have will be somewhat random with higher probability of one color over another. 

I did not collaborate with anyone to write this code

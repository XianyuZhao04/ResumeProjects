an application for food trucks and people who like food trucks

Our web application amplifies diner and vendor's love for food. Connecting diner and vendor through pathfinding on a map. Our application solves the problem of foodtruck's not having their own platform to advertise themselves. Unified under a platform that amplifiy all of their voices.

The home screen asks if they're a foodtruck or a user. What our program does is (given the vendor has the required licenses) the foodtruck can input their real time location for customers to find them. Users are guided to foodtrucks via pathfinding.
